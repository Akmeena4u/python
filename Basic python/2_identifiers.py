#Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
#Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
#Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable,
#you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:


"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
