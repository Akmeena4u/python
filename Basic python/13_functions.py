#A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

#You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

#A function can return data as a result.

#If the number of arguments is unknown, add a * before the parameter name:

#In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:


def greetings(names):
	for name in names:
		print('Hello', name)


names = ['Anuj', 'Shivam', 'Rohits']
greetings(names)




















# def sum_of_list(a):
# 	print('Calculating...')
# 	return sum(a)

# marks = [45, 16, 87, 98, 45]
# sum_of_marks = sum_of_list(marks)

# print('my sum of marks', sum_of_marks)























# def greet(name, dish="Pasta"):
# 	print('Good Morning,', name)
# 	print('Please eat', dish)


# greet('Anuj', 'Samosa')






















# from math import *

# import my_module as mm

# print(mm.average(4, 5))
