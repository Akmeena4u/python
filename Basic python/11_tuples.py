/*
Python Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition
but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists which are mutable.


# s = "Anuj"
# s[0] = 'C'

a = ('A', 'n', 'u', 'j')
a[0] = 'c' #not supported


print(a)


#ex-2
var = ("Geeks", "for", "Geeks")

print("Value in Var[0] = ", var[0])
print("Value in Var[1] = ", var[1])
print("Value in Var[2] = ", var[2])
